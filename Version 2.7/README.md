# CRUD-Application-using-PHP-and-MySQL
* We start with TWO basic functionalities of a complete website, i.e., **CREATE and READ** in _Version 1.0_.
* Each version contains all the modified files along with the associated _README.md_ file to provide you with a  
  hand out which will might help you to run the application.
* Hence with each update more features will be added in this application. In the final version we will  
  be getting a CRUD application.
